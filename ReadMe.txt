CypherPic 1.1.1
Fonazza-Stent 2024
Encrypt and decrypt an image

The program can encrypt an image, save it to a file, then decrypt
and display it.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- File – Load Image or Alt-L to load an image
- File – Encode Image or Alt-E to encode an image.
If no image is loaded a file window will open to load an image.
A dialog window will ask you to input a password, then you will be
asked to choose a folder and a filename to save the encrypted file.
- File – Decode or Alt-D to decode an image.
A file window will pop up to load the encrypted file. Locate the
file and open it. Input the password you have used to encode the
file in the password dialog window. The decoded image will be
displayed in the main window. For now, there’s a size limitation of
600 height and 800 width and the image cannot be zoomed or enlarged
to full screen size.
 - Edit - Paste to paste an image from the clipboard.

The program will not save the password anywhere so there’s no way to
retrieve it once you’ve entered it, and you will have to remember it 
correctly in order to decrypt the image.
The decoded image will also not be saved anywhere, but only displayed in
the program window.

New in this version:

- Can paste an image from the clipboard
